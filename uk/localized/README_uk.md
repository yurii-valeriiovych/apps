Here you will find the repositories and versions of every apps available in YunoHost's default catalog.

It is browsable here: https://yunohost.org/apps

The main file of the catalog is [**apps.toml**](./apps.toml) which contains references to the corresponding Git repositories for each application, along with a few metadata about them such as its category or maintenance state. This file regularly read by `list_builder.py` which publish the results on https://app.yunohost.org/default/.

### Where can I learn about app packaging in YunoHost?

- You can browse the contributor documentation : https://yunohost.org/contributordoc
- If you are not familiar with Git/GitHub, you can have a look at our [homemade guide](https://yunohost.org/#/packaging_apps_git)
- Don't hesitate to reach for help on the dedicated [application packaging chatroom](https://yunohost.org/chat_rooms) ... we can even schedule an audio meeting to help you get started!

### How to add your app to the application catalog

> **Note** The YunoHost project will **NOT** integrate in its catalog applications that are not based on free-software upstreams.

> **Note** We strongly encourage you to transfer the ownership of your repository to the YunoHost-Apps organization on GitHub, such that the community will help you with keeping your app working and up to date with packaging evolutions on the long run.

To add your application to the catalog:
* Fork this repository and edit the [apps.toml](https://github.com/YunoHost/apps/tree/master/apps.toml) file
* Add your app's ID and git information at the right alphabetical place
* Indicate the app's functioning state: `notworking`, `inprogress`, or `working`
* Indicate the app category, which you can pick from `categories.toml`
* Indicate any anti-feature that your app may be subject to, see `antifeatures.toml` (or remove the `antifeatures` key if there's none)
* Indicate if your app can be thought of as an alternative to popular proprietary services (or remove the `potential_alternative_to` key if there's none)
* *Do not* add the `level` entry by yourself. Our automatic test suite ("the CI") will handle it.
* Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/YunoHost/apps/pulls/)

App example addition:
```toml
[your_app]
antifeatures = [ "deprecated-software" ]   # Remove if no relevant antifeature applies
potential_alternative_to = [ "YouTube" ]   # Indicate if your app can be thought of as an alternative to popular proprietary services (or remove if none applies)
category = "foobar"                        # Replace with the appropriate category id found in categories.toml
state = "working"
url = "https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/your_app_ynh"
```

> **Warning** Implicitly, the catalog publishes the `HEAD` of branch `master` (this can be overwritten by adding keys `branch` and `revision`). Therefore, **be careful that any commit on the `master` branch will automatically be published**. **We strongly encourage you to develop in separate branches**, and only merge changes that were carefully tested. Get in touch with the Apps group to obtain an access to the developer CI where you'll be able to test your app easily.

### Updating apps levels in the catalog

App packagers should *not* manually set their apps' level. The levels of all the apps are automatically updated once per week on Friday, according to the results from the official app CI.

### Apps flagged as not-maintained

Applications with no recent activity and no active sign from maintainer may be flagged in `apps.toml` with the `package-not-maintained` antifeature tag to signify that the app is inactive and may slowly become outdated with respect to the upstream, or with respect to good packaging practices. It does **not** mean that the app is not working anymore.

Feel free to contact the app group if you feel like taking over the maintenance of a currently unmaintained app!
